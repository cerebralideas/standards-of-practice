# Conduct Standards – Full

**Unity from Diversity through Empowerment.**

Like any community, the Austin, PayPal-engineering community should conduct itself according to a simple set of standards and guidelines. This Code of Conduct (from here-on-out, referred to as CoC) acts as a set of guidelines[1] to create a framework for not just producing quality products, but also for cultivating a quality community with one another.

First and foremost, we are nothing without each other. As much as society perceives software engineering as a “loner” type task (envision some hooded hacker in a dark room banging out lines of code), it couldn’t be further from the truth. What we do requires just as much people skills as it does technical skills to ensure success.

This is going to outline the *non*-technical aspects of how we become successful together. The technical aspects are documented in the "Engineering Standards of Practice" (link).

## 1. We are a community of individuals

There are three subjects that should be avoided while at work:

1. Politics
2. Religion
3. Sex

Not that these are inherently evil/bad subjects, but to ensure we preserve a unified, diverse community, we need to respect the fact that these are sensitive topics for many. This alone will create a more inclusive, conflict-free environment that will increase the cohesiveness of all in our community.

A supportive community is what creates resilient individuals, and resilience is what's need to endure the frustrations commonly seen in competitive tech environments[2].


### a. Be nice/Be respectful

To build a successful community, we must see each other, no matter how similar or different[3], as a crucial part of this community, and its success. That means we leave the personal differences and beliefs at the door and treat everyone with the respect and the patience they need to flourish and be successful.

This helps cultivate a quality environment for producing quality products. There is *no way* the environment in which we work has *no* impact on the products we produce, and eventually, the quality of the customer experience. The more empowering and inclusive our environment, the better the over quality of PayPal’s products and services.

### b. Be helpful/Share knowledge

There is no single individual that knows more than a community, especially a diverse community. Knowledge sharing is one of the most empowering things you can not only do for an individual, but for the community as a whole. 

Our priorities should be community focused, not individually focused. Any knowledge that makes an individual engineer successful should be shared and distributed to make us all successful.

**Don’t be a rockstar or ninja, be a mentor, teacher or counselor.**

Our expectation is for all engineers to evaluate and pride themselves on not only the quality of the code they author but also the amount of growth from those that they help or mentor.

What’s more, engineers are encouraged to lead small, local brown-bags or lightening talks sharing something learned or passionate topics. The goal of this is to create an environment where sharing and learning is a business priority for all and doing so is as frictionless as possible.

### c. Ask for help

Most importantly, ask for help. This should go without saying, but too many times engineers have been observed struggling with something for far too long without asking for help. This is too costly for both the business and the individual.

Often, the reason engineers are afraid to ask for help is they are afraid of being judged or criticized for not knowing something. This is the biggest reason to create the above mentioned environment. We need to remove the negative stigma of asking for, or needing, help. Asking for help is absolutely crucial as no one knows everything, even the most senior of engineers.

### d. Have fun and ensure others do as well

Last by not least, take breaks, go out for lunch, laugh. Find inclusive ways to bring other aspects of enjoyment into our workplace. There's nothing prescriptive here other than just try to find ways to break the frustration and stress[4].

## 2. Everything is a conversation

### a. Don’t be afraid to push back/say “No”

Operating within an environment that empowers individuals to push back and/or say *no* is crucial to quality output[5]. But, “with great power comes great responsibility”, so a *no* should always be followed up by a well articulated rationale and/or educational response. 

**A “No” is always customer focused**.

As engineers, we are the last remaining barrier from a bad user experience. People make mistakes, requirements fall through the cracks and things get overlooked. If we don’t ask questions, critique requirements and inquire about intentions, no one else has a chance to stop it.

No matter what anyone says, the product that we produce is *always* a compromise between a dozen or so “actors”. Marketing, design, budget, legal, business, product, engineering, customers and others all have their priorities, and many (if not all) times, they are not all aligned. So, compromise is the name of the game, and to do that, engineers have to speak up about their responsibilities.

As an engineer, you represent the engineering department, and you have your priorities: performance, maintainability, scalability, understandability, reliability, usability and aesthetic of the product. These are rarely the priorities of other actors, so if you don’t fight for them, there will be no compromise and inclusion of them.

**Because of this, conflict resolution is a must have, crucial skill.**

### b. Slow down and build great things

To have the conversations we need to ensure quality output, we have to have the necessary time. Whether it’s with product, design, QA or each other, we have to have a process that ensures the time to properly discuss our product.

As has been said many times, speed and quality are almost always "at ends with each other". It's not one or the other, it's a compromise. Speed without quality produces unmaintainable products, and quality without speed produces products that are late to market or not innovating.

Tradeoffs are always made, but a balance has to be reached between these two aspects of what we do. 

If speed is prioritized over quality, then an agreement has to be made between engineering and other teams that quality will take precedence soon to ensure a balance. This will be, and should be, a constant tug and pull, but with a long term symmetry.

### c. Code ownership/PR reviews

**Writing code for an organization like PayPal is *not* an expression of your individuality.** *It should express the standards and conventions of the community that owns it.*[6] Code reviews should be a daily process between us all and should be an engineer’s way to converse about the product.

Critiques of code should never be given or interpreted as a critique of the author. They should always be given as a representation of the community and should be taken as the community speaking about the product overall.

Code comments should be focused on enforcing standards and conventions, maintainability and understandability. Code is almost never wrong, stupid or bad, code is always a result of many factors and compromises, so no comment should communicate such an idea.

**Write code for the future maintainers, knowing that it will *not* be you.**

As a code reviewer, one of the most common comments left in a PR should relate to the understandability of code. *Code has a greater impact on the humans that have to maintain it than on the computer that has to execute it.* After a year or so, the large majority of code *will be* maintained by engineers that are not the original authors. This fact is crucial to understand for all.

The end result of a code review is a conversation that you are having with the community about code that everyone owns, together.

## 3. Conflict resolution

Conflicts will happen as there is no one right-way to author code, so opinions are abound. To handle this, we need to have a set of practices to refer to, along with just plain old compromise and understanding.

### a. Establish a proper dialogue

The first step to conflict resolution is a conversation. This means taking the time to discuss the topic in a manner that establishes an understanding of the other party’s position. The goal of this conversation is *not* to convince the other party of your opinion, but for you to understand theirs.

**In other words: don’t talk at, talk with; listen (and ask questions).**

If a resolution can be found through a simple dialogue between parties, then all is well.

### b. Standards of practice

This will be the document that sets the guidelines, rules and conventions for authoring code and contributing to projects. Use this to settle disagreements. 

Each team should have a standards of practice for each language that is used, how to contribute to a project and how to deploy code to production. There's few better ways to handle disagreements than referring to a standards document.

### c. “When in Rome”

If the standards of practice do not address the conflict, please rely on the existing conventions within the project. This comes from the age old saying, “When in Rome, do as the Romans.”

If there’s an established convention already in the project, then let that be the guideline to resolving the conflict. Again, makes rue the code you are writing or reviewing reflects that of the community, not yourself.

### d. When all else fails …

Contact a senior engineer or engineering manager for resolution, but whatever you do, we keep it civil and non-personal. We *do not* use intimidation or ad-hominem attacks as tools for “winning” arguments.

Let the manager or senior engineer set the final word; accept it, and move on. Again, we don’t author code to express our individuality or creativity. We write code for our customers and for PayPal.

## 4. Build with empathy [7,8]

Everything we build needs to be built with a deep consideration for the user. Because we build things that millions of people use, we have to be cognizant that we have a responsibility due to the trust that millions of users put into our hands.

Whether it be that we keep their data secure or money safe, or that we ensure that new features are usable and accessible to the widest of spectrum of capabilities, we have to have empathy for all that interact with our systems. Not doing so due to time constraints, bad days or conflicts, can have irreversible side-effects on real humans.

One careless mistake could potentially facilitate in a family losing their ability to pay rent, or put food on their table. As we move into more countries and diverse economic conditions, this becomes paramount in what we do and how we do it.

**Do it with care and empathy!**
