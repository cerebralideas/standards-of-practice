## We believe the following are critical to our engineering success:

### 1. Code authoring

Coding for the future (and the future maintainers) enhances the maintainability of the software and makes the code adapt to changing needs of the business. Following a few, basic, but at times forgotten, principles can dramatically increase the quality of your code long-term.

### 2. Code review

A software engineer and a novelist share one thing in common: what they write should be reviewed and critiqued before being published. Code reviews are a critical responsibility of engineers and should be a daily task supported by all.

### 3. Testing

Automated testing (function, unit or other) not only improves the quality of the code but improves the speed and predictability of development. Running automated tests daily through CI will ensure defects are found earlier in the process.

### 4. Quality code analysis

Code coverage, static code analysis and other automated, quality assurance tools help identify potential bugs, dead code or poor patterns, making sure all paths of the code are covered, analysed and dead paths removed.

### 5. Continuous Integration

Everything we build needs to go through CI process which will ensure builds and deployments are streamlined, predictable and consistent.

### 6. Code management practices

Established good code management practices within teams are critical for making sure the changes to the code are well tracked, reviewed and logged. A reliable, predictable process is paramount.

### 7. Documentation

Documenting everything from your end-to-end release process, to your guidelines for contributions and code reviews, is a critical practice to ensure a sustainable, high-quality development process.

#### We deeply believe that the above processes will not only help you achieve better quality of the software delivered, but create a better development experience from creation to production. If you believe the same, please join us in making PayPal a better place engineering excellence!
