## We believe the following are critical to our engineering success:

### 1. Reduce environmental frictions

As engineers, distractions, frustrations and unresolvable conflicts are all frictions to doing your job well. Reducing these frictions can overwhelmingly increase productivity. Let's stand together to do what's best for us all, and actively reduce these obstacles.

### 2. Proactively communicate

Sharing knowledge, reducing hesitancy to ask questions, talk about code, think aloud with teammates, properly & critically review code in PRs ... it's all about being proactive about communication early to reduce surprises, conflicts and tech debt in the future.

### 3. We are curators of software

Building software is just as much about what you don't implement as it is what you do. Ask questions, push back, have a conversation (see number 2) arrive at compromises. As engineers, we are a stockholder in the product, so our voice is important.

### 4. Code is community owned

Write code for the future maintainer. A rarely spoken consequence of working for an organization like PayPal is we rarely, if ever, own the code we wrote a year ago. With that said, you are fundamentally writing code for whomever will eventually inherit it.

### 5. Build with empathy

Everything we build needs to be developed with a deep consideration for all users, not just the ones that "reflect" us. Because we build things that hundreds of millions of people use, we have to ensure that we build things that *never* risk their safety, privacy and security, no matter how valuable or fashionable we believe it may be.

#### We believe the above will provide a better, more professional environment so we call all achieve a greater success. We hope you do! Join us in making PayPal the best for all of us, employees and customers alike.
