# Definition of Ready

All stories considered within a sprint should have been groomed in the previous backlog grooming.
Exceptions can be made by the team on an as needed basis.
Designs linked, if the story is a flow this should include all pages, and various examples of all states included, errors, etc.
Images that pertain to the specific story should be called out.
If links to box documents are provided we need good communication between design and development if changes are made mid-sprint.
developers should reach out to designers before starting work to make sure designs linked are the most recent.
if desired; developer may attach screenshot of design state at time work on story was started.
changes to design mid-sprint may affect the ability of development team to complete story. developer should communicate at the time change is noticed.
Design verification by UED
Content doc attached, if it is a small change a doc may not be needed but the content should be included.
Having this when we start working on a story will mean we can get the content PR prepped and submitted asap: Content Localization Schedule
If there were spikes associated with the story the findings should be included in either the notes section or in an attachment to the story.
Story should identify any locale specific implementation details in locale support if necessary.
