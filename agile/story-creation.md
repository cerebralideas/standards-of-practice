# Writing a Rally story should be a discipline

Each story should have the following items (attachments should be directly linked to the file, not folder/directory):

	1. Summary
	2. Acceptance Criteria address the child story specifically
	3. The core design file: this is the wireframe or visual mock
	4. Responsive variants in low-fidelity
	5. Content document in plaintext
	6. Specifications of rules, compliance and regulatory concerns
	7. Region or market application

Stories can evolve over time, especially as they are being groomed, but once a story is accepted into a sprint, it is to be considered immutable. All changes to a story should be done in the discussion tab as a time-stamped comment. It is then that person's responsibility to reach out the the current owner of that story and notify them of the change.

All discovery, blocking or completion information should happen transparently in Rally. Centralization of story information is critical. If a meeting takes place that discusses the story, write the outcome and actionable items in the story to ensure it's properly documented.
